# An Empirical Algorithms Comparison

This project investigates a machine learning algorithmsâ€™ performance comparison for binary classification problems, replicating a small-scale experiment carried out by Caruana and Niculescu Mizil 2006 paper, which will be referred to as CNM06. Specifically, this paper will compare between three supervised machine learning methods, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and K-nearest neighbor. The error metrics used to compare the algorithms are accuracy, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and F1 score.
